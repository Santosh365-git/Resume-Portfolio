		<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h1>
    <p>Credit card fraud detection refers to the use of various techniques and technologies to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions on credit cards. This can include analyzing patterns in transaction data, monitoring for unusual activity, and using machine learning algorithms to identify potential fraud. Advanced fraud detection systems can also incorporate biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to further enhance security. Fraud detection is essential for protecting both consumers and financial institutions from financial losses and reputational damage. Effective fraud detection requires ongoing monitoring and analysis of transaction data, as well as collaboration between financial institutions, merchants, and law enforcement agencies.</p>
