		<h1>Reliance Smart [1 year]</h1>
    <p>Working in Reliance Smart during a job involved several activities that required the use of various technologies and dealing with a lot of pressure while handling customers. One of the primary responsibilities was managing the inventory and ensuring that the products were always available for customers. This required the use of inventory management software that helped keep track of the stock levels and reorder products when necessary.

      Another critical aspect of the job was dealing with customers. Customers had different needs and preferences, and it was essential to understand their requirements to provide them with the right product. This required effective communication skills and the ability to handle difficult customers. To provide the best customer experience, we had to use customer relationship management (CRM) software that helped keep track of customer interactions, preferences, and purchasing history.
      
      The job also involved dealing with a lot of pressure. There were several customers to attend to, and we had to work efficiently to ensure that all customers were satisfied with our services. Additionally, we had to manage the inventory, deal with suppliers, and handle other administrative tasks. This required the use of time-management and organizational tools to prioritize tasks and complete them on time.
      
      In conclusion, working in Reliance Smart during a job required the use of several technologies such as inventory management software and customer relationship management (CRM) software. Additionally, handling customers involved effective communication skills, understanding customer needs, and dealing with a lot of pressure. The job helped develop essential skills such as time-management, organization, and customer service skills.</p>

		<h1>Hoping Mind [Ongoing]</h1>
		<p>Working at Hoping Mind company, where I am learning full-stack web development, has been an incredible experience so far. As a beginner, I had no prior experience in web development, but the company has provided me with an excellent platform to learn and grow in this field.

      The first step in my journey was to understand the basics of web development. This included learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the fundamental building blocks of any website. The company provided me with online resources, study materials, and mentors to help me get started.
      
      Once I had a good grasp of the basics, I was introduced to more advanced concepts such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB. These technologies are the backbone of full-stack web development, and learning them has been challenging yet exciting. The company has provided me with several opportunities to apply my skills to real-world projects, which has helped me understand the practical aspects of web development.
      
      In addition to learning technical skills, the company has also helped me develop soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and time-management. Collaborating with other developers on projects has been a great learning experience, and I have gained valuable insights into the industry and its practices.
      
      Overall, working at Hoping Mind company has been a rewarding experience. I am grateful for the support and guidance provided by the company, which has helped me in my journey towards becoming a full-stack web developer.
